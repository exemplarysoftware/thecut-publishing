The Cut Django App: Publishing

=================
thecut.publishing
=================

To install this application (whilst in the project's activated virtualenv)::
    pip install git+ssh://git@git.thecut.net.au/thecut-publishing


There is no need to add ``thecut.publishing`` to your project's
``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting, as it provides only abstract models.
